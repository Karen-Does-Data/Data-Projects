# Data-Projects

Welcome to my data projects! The first project is an exploration of Iowa liquor sales from BigQuery. My goal was to practice my SQL skills and see what information I could find in the data. Although the data was mostly clean, the biggest challenge was the mixed use case for text. Some items were in all upper case, others in all lower case, or proper case. I decided to put those items in lower case to keep it simple and it gave me a chance to practice subqueries. I focused my exploration on finding the most popular items by and sales over time.
